Promises :

to handle async operation 

in async codes are not excecuted line by line 


we can also use CALL Back but chaining is not good to use.

Solution is Promise 


A Promise has four states:

fulfilled
rejected 
pending
settled


fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded.
rejected: Action related to the promise failed.
pending: Promise is still pending i.e. not fulfilled or rejected yet.
settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected.


Note:

await must be written inside try catch block 

because await only handles resolve and to handle reject we have to write it inside catch block
